00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
like if I drop out halfway into it I can
 

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.530 align:start position:0%
like if I drop out halfway into it I can

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
now I get my 8 000 back and so I decided
 

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.970 align:start position:0%
